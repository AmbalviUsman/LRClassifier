# LRClassifier
This is Machine Learning second Assignment.

Get a dataset for a classification problem. (Binary classification is sufficient.)

Write vectorized code for performing the classification. Make sure you do not use any explicit loops within one iteration but you can use an outer loop for performing iterations. You can decide the stopping criteria yourself. 

Plot the loss for different values of alpha that you try.
